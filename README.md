🚀 DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Project
This project demonstrates a basic end-to-end CI/CD pipeline for a Java application using:

GitHub — Version control

Jenkins — Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

Maven — Build automation

Docker — Containerization

Kubernetes — Orchestration and deployment

The pipeline automatically builds the application, packages it into a Docker image, pushes the image to Docker Hub, and deploys it to a Kubernetes cluster.
